## Docker Compose Setup

The EMR system uses the following services in Docker Compose:
- **Backend (Node.js)**: Manages core EMR functionality.
- **HAPI FHIR Server**: Handles FHIR resources and data.
- **MongoDB**: Stores structured EMR data.
- **RabbitMQ**: Manages asynchronous message queuing.

### `docker-compose.yml` Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    image: node:16
    container_name: emr_backend
    working_dir: /usr/src/app
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/usr/src/app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    command: ["npm", "start"]
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
      - rabbitmq

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: emr_mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db

  hapi-fhir:
    image: hapiproject/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter:latest
    container_name: hapi_fhir
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:management
    container_name: emr_rabbitmq
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: user
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: password

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
Usage
Save the file as docker-compose.yml in your project root.
Run the services:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Access points:
Backend: http://localhost:5000
MongoDB: localhost:27017
HAPI FHIR: http://localhost:8080
RabbitMQ Management: http://localhost:15672
AWS Deployment Guide
1. Set Up AWS Services
Amazon ECR: Stores Docker images.
Amazon ECS: Orchestrates containerized services.
Amazon RDS: Provides a production-grade relational database.
2. Deploy Docker Images to ECR
Build Docker images locally:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t emr-backend ./backend
Tag and push to ECR:
bash
Copy code
docker tag emr-backend:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/emr-system:backend
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/emr-system:backend
3. Set Up ECS Cluster
Create an ECS cluster with Fargate launch type.
Define ECS task definitions for each service.
4. Set Up RDS Database
Create a PostgreSQL or MySQL instance in RDS.
Configure backend services to connect using the RDS endpoint.
CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
GitHub Actions Workflow
Add the following file to .github/workflows/deploy.yml in your repository:

yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Log in to Amazon ECR
        id: login-ecr
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

      - name: Build, Tag, and Push Docker Image
        run: |
          IMAGE_URI="${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}/${{ secrets.ECR_REPOSITORY }}"
          docker build -t $IMAGE_URI:latest .
          docker push $IMAGE_URI:latest

      - name: Deploy to Amazon ECS
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
        with:
          cluster: ${{ secrets.ECS_CLUSTER }}
          service: ${{ secrets.ECS_SERVICE }}
          force-new-deployment: true
Advanced Routing for Multi-Hospital Systems
Mirth Connect
Use JavaScript filters in Mirth to route messages based on the sending facility (MSH-4 field):

javascript
Copy code
var sendingFacility = msg['MSH']['MSH.4']['MSH.4.1'].toString();
if (sendingFacility === 'HospitalA') {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
RabbitMQ
Use a topic exchange to route messages:

Routing key: <hospital>.<department>
Example:
bash
Copy code
rabbitmqadmin declare binding source=multi_hospital_exchange destination=hospitalA_lab routing_key=hospitalA.lab
Monitoring and Logging for Middleware
Prometheus and Grafana
Use Prometheus to scrape metrics from RabbitMQ and HAPI FHIR.
Deploy Grafana for dashboard visualization.
Logging
Use winston for structured logging in the backend:
javascript
Copy code
const logger = require('winston');
logger.info('Message logged');
Conclusion
This guide provides the foundational setup for deploying and managing an EMR system with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and AWS. Customize configurations to meet specific healthcare compliance requirements like HIPAA or GDPR.
