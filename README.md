## Docker Compose Setup

The EMR system uses the following services in Docker Compose:
- **Backend (Node.js)**: Manages core EMR functionality.
- **HAPI FHIR Server**: Handles FHIR resources and data.
- **MongoDB**: Stores structured EMR data.
- **RabbitMQ**: Manages asynchronous message queuing.

### `docker-compose.yml` Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    image: node:16
    container_name: emr_backend
    working_dir: /usr/src/app
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/usr/src/app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    command: ["npm", "start"]
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
      - rabbitmq

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: emr_mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db

  hapi-fhir:
    image: hapiproject/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter:latest
    container_name: hapi_fhir
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:management
    container_name: emr_rabbitmq
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: user
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: password
